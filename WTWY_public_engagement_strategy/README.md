# WomenTechWomenYes Public Engagement Strategy

The goal for the project was to help WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY), a fictitious organization, devise a strategy to build public awareness about their organization and mission. My partner and I explored the New York MTA subway data to make our recommendations of locations to place street teams at entrances to subway stations. [This](https://ailchau.github.io/project1-MTA/) is a blog post about my experience.

Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
