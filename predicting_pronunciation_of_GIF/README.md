# Predicting the Pronunciation of GIF

For my third Metis project, I built classification models to predict how people pronounced GIF using responses collected from the 2017 StackOverflow Developers Survey. I used scikit-learn to build the classification models and Bokeh to create interactive plots.

### Main contents:
- [pronunciation_of_GIF.ipynb](pronunciation_of_GIF.ipynb) contains the python code for data wrangling, feature engineering, and model fitting

- [bokeh_plots.ipynb](bokeh_plots.ipynb) contains the python code for creating the plots ([gif_plots.html](gif_plots.html) is the html output)
