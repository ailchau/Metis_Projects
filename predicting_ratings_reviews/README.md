# Predicting Ratings vs. Reviews

For my second Metis project, I was interested in the difference between the number of ratings and reviews for fiction books. I used Beautiful Soup to scrape information from the Goodreads website and built a linear regression model to predict the ratio between the number of ratings and reviews. You can find my blog post about this project [here](https://ailchau.github.io/predicting-ratings-reviews/).
