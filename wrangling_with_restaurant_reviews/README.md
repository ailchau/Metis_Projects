# Wrangling with Restaurant Reviews

For this project, I was interested in identifying the values of Toronto restaurant diners. As Canada's largest city, Toronto has an active and diverse food scene. I used Toronto restaurant reviews taken from the [Yelp Dataset Challenge](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge) and applied sentiment analysis, dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised clustering. You can find my blog post about this project [here](https://ailchau.github.io/restaurant_reviews/).

Tools: NLTK, Spacy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and AWS
